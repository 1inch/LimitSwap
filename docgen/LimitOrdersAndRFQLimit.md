# The Difference between Limit orders and RFQ Limit orders

## Limit Orders:
A limit order is an order to buy or sell a specific asset at a specified price or better. The order will be executed only at the specified price or better. If the price is not met, the order will remain open until the price is reached or the order is canceled. Limit orders can be used to buy or sell any asset, including cryptocurrencies, stocks, and commodities.

## RFQ Limit Orders:
RFQ stands for "Request for Quote." In RFQ Limit Orders, the trader sends a request for a quote to a market maker or a liquidity provider. The market maker or liquidity provider then provides a quote for the asset. The quote includes the price and the size of the order. The trader can then decide whether to accept the quote or not.

## The Difference
- The key difference between Limit orders and RFQ Limit orders is the way in which the order is executed. In Limit orders, the order is executed at the specified price or better, whereas in RFQ Limit orders, the trader has the option to accept or reject the quote provided by the market maker or liquidity provider.

- Another difference between Limit orders and RFQ Limit orders is the way in which liquidity is provided. In Limit orders, liquidity is provided by the order book, whereas in RFQ Limit orders, liquidity is provided by the market maker or liquidity provider.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, both Limit orders and RFQ Limit orders have their advantages and disadvantages. Limit orders provide more control over the execution price, while RFQ Limit orders provide the option to accept or reject a quote provided by a market maker or liquidity provider. Traders should choose the order type that best suits their trading strategy and goals.
